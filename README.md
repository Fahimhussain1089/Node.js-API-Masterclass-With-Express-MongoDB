Create a real world backend for a bootcamp directory app

This is a project based course where we build an extensive, in-depth backend API for DevCamper, a bootcamp directory API. We will start from scratch and end up with a professional deployed API with documentation. We will dive deep into Node, Express and MongoDB. Here is some of what you will learn in this course and project...

HTTP Essentials

Postman Client

RESTful APIS

Express Framework

Routing & Controller Methods

MongoDB Atlas & Compass

Mongoose ODM

Advanced Query (Pagination, filter, etc)

Models & Relationships

Middleware (Express & Mongoose)

MongoDB Geospatial Index / GeoJSON

Geocoding

Custom Error Handling

User Roles & Permissions

Aggregation

Photo Upload

Authentication With JWT & Cookies

Emailing Password Reset Tokens

Custom Database Seeder Using JSON Files

Password & Token Hashing

Security: NoSQL Injection, XSS, etc

Creating Documentation

Deployment With PM2, NGINX, SSL

Web development is changing. We used to render all of our views and templates on the server, but since the rise of frontend frameworks like React, Angular and Vue, we are now splitting projects up into backend and frontend, where the backend is doing all of the database interaction and serving JSON and the frontend is fetching that data and creating the user interface to interact with. This course will teach you the entire backend side of things so that you can build extensive APIs and then use whatever you want on the frontend.

We will do a lot more than just build a simple CRUD REST API like many other Node.js and Express tutorials. We will be implementing reset tokens, email Irse teaches what authentication, role functionality, geoc It has Slided to the bottom it's like to be a real backend engineer.
